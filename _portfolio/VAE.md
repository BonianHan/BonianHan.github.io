title: "VAE feature extractor"
excerpt: "Developed a probabilistic generative model featuring an encoder that replaces fully connected layers with flexible neural network layers, enhancing adaptability. The decoder utilizes deconvolution to improve predictive performance and model robustness. This framework employs probabilistic embedding to capture complex data distributions, address model uncertainty, and mitigate bias, facilitating high-quality sample generation for improved downstream tasks."
