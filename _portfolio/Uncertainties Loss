excerpt: "RandomCrop Uncertainties Loss combined with Dynamic Weights. The extraction of [the paper](http://bonianhan.github.io/publications/) with more and more varied image datasets and the largest ever scale of training, expecting a state-of-the-art performance. <br>Finally, we failed thought. This method was not as useful as we thought... But, it's OK. I thought this algorithm is not mature yet. When I get more knowledge, I will revisit it."
