🤓 I am pursuing a B.S. in Statistics at the [School of Economics](https://economics.hdu.edu.cn/eco_en/), [Hangzhou Dianzi University](https://www.hdu.edu.cn/main.htm), and expect to graduate in the summer of 2025.

👨‍💻 I am currently working with Prof. [Gongbo Liang](http://www.gb-liang.com/)  at [Texa A&M University-San Antonio](https://www.tamusa.edu/) research in image classification.

👨‍🎓 I am actively seeking a Ph.D. program for Fall 2025.


🔎 My research interests are in:

### a) Trustworthy Neural Networks:
- Deep Neural Network Model Calibration: Research on improving the alignment between the confidence and accuracy of model predictions.
- Model Feature Extractor: Development of efficient and interpretable feature extraction techniques.
- Loss Algorithm: Design of new loss functions to optimize the training process.
- Graph Neural Network Explainer: Exploration of the working mechanisms of graph neural networks to enhance their interpretability.

### b) AI for Science:
- Medical Image Classification: Utilizing AI technology to improve disease diagnosis and treatment.
- Remote Sensing Classification: Applying machine learning methods to process and analyze satellite and aerial imagery data, supporting environmental monitoring and disaster assessment.

### c) Computer Vision:
- In-depth research on core issues such as image recognition, object detection, and scene understanding, driving the development of computer vision technologies and their practical applications.
